# Provisional Porfolio

I did this in order to send my projects just in one url instead of sending a bunch of them in a e-mail or in a random message.

Since I have not yet a fornal porfolio, this could be useful to do an small presentation.

It is not AT ALL my serious porfolio, the good one is coming soon.

## "deeper" technical explanation

Very simple, I created a HTML and CSS file a bit of grid and flexbox, ctrl+V some of the projects I was already sending to some potential employeers, and this is it.

I hope you apreciate the content (the projects) not this site by itselft ðŸ˜Š
